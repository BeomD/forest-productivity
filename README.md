## 🚀 Overview

Forest Focus is a minimal, distraction-aware productivity app where:
- 🌱 A tree grows when you stay focused.
- 🥀 The tree dies if you switch apps or leave the session.
- 🌲 Your focus history builds a visual forest.
- 📊 Your productivity is analyzed with charts and analytics.

Instead of tracking boring streaks, the app visualizes your productivity as a **living forest that evolves over time**.

## ✨ Features

### ⏳ Focus Timer
- 15m, 25m, 45m presets and custom duration options.
- Live countdown with Pause and Give Up options.
- Visual tree growth animation during focus sessions.

### 🌲 Gamified Focus System
- Tree grows during an active focus session.
- Tree dies if the user switches apps or gets distracted.
- Real consequence-driven productivity: visual seed → roots → trunk → branches → leaves growth.

### 🌳 3D Forest Visualization
Your completed sessions grow trees inside a **large dynamic forest**.
- Every completed session plants a tree positioned across the forest landscape.
- Depth scaling creates a 3D forest illusion.
- Forest gradually fills as productivity increases, creating a living ecosystem of productivity.

### 📊 My Forest Dashboard & Analytics
The Forest screen contains a full analytics dashboard to help you understand your patterns:
- **Session Statistics:** Trees Grown, Trees Died, Total Focus Time, Average Session Duration.
- **Time Distribution Chart:** See when you are most productive (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night).
- **Productivity Analytics:** Switch between Day, Week, Month, and Year views to see how productivity evolves.
- **Focus Calendar:** Highlights days with completed sessions to track streaks and long-term consistency.

### 🌗 Theming
- Light Mode & Dark Mode.
- Clean forest-inspired green aesthetic with a minimal, distraction-free UI.

### 👛 Solana Wallet Integration
- Integrated Solana wallet support built for a Web3-native mobile experience.
- Foundation for on-chain incentives, focus rewards, and future token mechanics.

## 🧠 Concept

Most productivity apps track time. **Forest Focus tracks consequences.**

If you stay in the app → your tree grows.  
If you leave → your tree dies.  

Behavioral design meets minimal UX. Over time, your focus sessions create a visual forest representing your productivity journey.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/forest-focus.git
cd forest-focus
```

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Start the Expo server

```bash
npx expo start
```
## 🐳 Web Deployment (Docker)

The app ships as a static web build served by nginx, with the image built
inside Docker (no Node.js required on the host).

### Layout

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Host port | `6666` |
| Container port | `80` |
| Container name | `forest-web` |
| Compose file | `docker-compose.yml` |

### Prerequisite — source at `/opt/Forest`

The build context is fixed to the host path **`/opt/Forest`**, so the source
must exist there on the Docker host (whichever host builds):

```bash
sudo git clone https://github.com/BeomD/forest-productivity /opt/Forest
```

### Option A — Portainer (Git repository stack)

1. **Stacks → Add stack → Build method: Repository**
2. Repository URL: `https://github.com/BeomD/forest-productivity`
3. Repository reference: `refs/heads/main`
4. Compose path: `docker-compose.yml`
5. (Private repo only) add your credentials / access token
6. **Deploy the stack**

Portainer clones the repo to read the compose file, but the image is still
built from **`/opt/Forest`** on the Docker host, so that path must exist
(see prerequisite). Use **Pull and redeploy** to apply source updates
(remember to `git -C /opt/Forest pull` first).

> Builds require a **standalone Docker** environment. On Docker **Swarm**,
> `build:` is not supported — build the image elsewhere and push it to a
> registry, then replace `build:` with `image:`.

### Option B — Local host

```bash
# 1. Source at /opt/Forest (see prerequisite)

# 2. Build and start
docker compose -f /opt/Forest/docker-compose.yml up -d --build

# 3. Verify
curl -I http://localhost:6666
```

The site is then reachable at `http://<host>:6666`. In **Nginx Proxy Manager
(NPM Plus)** create a proxy host that forwards your domain to
`http://<host-ip>:6666` and attach the TLS certificate there — HTTPS is
terminated by NPM Plus, not by this container.

### Updating

Re-run the build (`docker compose up -d --build`) or, in Portainer, use
**Pull and redeploy** on the stack.

### Notes

- The build lives inside the image; the build context is fixed to `/opt/Forest`.
- Client-side routing is handled by nginx (`try_files` → `*.html`), so deep
  links and refreshes work on any route.
- The Solana mobile wallet features only work in a mobile wallet browser;
  on desktop web the wallet actions are unavailable but the rest of the app
  works normally.
